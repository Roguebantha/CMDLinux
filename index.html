<p>LinuxCMD is a game written in Java to give people a thorough understanding of how a Linux command-line works and how useful it can be, along with teaching 29 different commands, as well as several concepts such as pipes, command history etc.</p>

<p>This game was created solely by Seth Jenkins (<a href="https://github.com/Roguebantha" class="user-mention">@Roguebantha</a>), but was advised by at the time of writing Lieutenant-Commander-Select Dane Brown at the United States Naval Academy. </p>

<p>I, Seth Jenkins, am available at <a href="mailto:starwarsfreak000@gmail.com">starwarsfreak000@gmail.com</a>. Feel free to send me an email if you have any questions, bugs, thank-you's, etc. After the summer of 2013, this game is not going to be actively supported, but I may be able to solve bugs anyway. I also love to hear that I was able to help someone out, so if I helped you, I'd  love to hear so!</p>
